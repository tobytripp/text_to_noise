Text-To-Noise
=============
Ambient log file monitoring.

Imagine if your servers created ambient noise instead of silent log messages.
What if your application infrastructure sounded like a jungle? Page views are
the chittering of crickets, logins are the cackle of monkeys, and errors are
the roar of a lion.  This is what `text_to_noise` can do.


Installation
------------

Stuff that I had to do to get this running:

1. Install the [SDL Mixer][sdlmixer] library.  I used [Homebrew][homebrew]:
    `brew install sdl sdl_mixer`

2. Install `text_to_noise` via [Rubygems][rubygems]:
    `gem install text-to-noise`


Configuration
=============

Text-To-Noise is configured with a Ruby file. The configuration contains a set
of rules for mapping a line of input text to a sound. Each mapping is a single
method of the form `map( pattern ).to "sound"`.

    map( /a regex matching log lines to trigger sounds/ ).to "a sound name to play"

For example,

    map( /Processing/ ).to "finch"

will match any input line that matches `/Processing/` and play the sound of a finch chirping.

A mapping may target multiple sounds for a given rule.  It can get boring to
hear the same sound every time a page is loaded.  Specify a set of sounds for 
a rule by passing it a list of sound names:

    map( /Processing/ ).to ["canary", "finch"]
   
the sounds will each be played in turn for each time the rule matches.


Dynamic Patterns
----------------

You can also apply more advanced rules for sound generation by supplying a
block to the match rule. The block is passed the [MatchData][MatchData:RDoc]
object returned from the regular expression match:

    map( /Completed in (\d+)ms/ ) { |match_data|
      match_data[1].to_i > 500
    }.to "vulture"

The above rule will play a vulture sound iff a line matches the expression _and_ the block
returns true.  Applied to a Rails log, the above rule will play a vulture sound whenever a 
page takes longer than 500ms to render.

For additional details, see the Cucumber [features][Features].  Also, have a 
look at the [sample][SampleConfig] configuration.

Included Sounds
---------------

`text-to-noise` currently comes with the following sounds for use in your
configurations:

    australian_frogmouth
    blue_amazon_macaw
    canary
    canary2
    cardinal
    chicken
    crickets
    crow-1
    crow
    finch
    geese
    hawk
    lapwing
    meadow_lark_long
    meadow_lark_short
    mexican_red_parrot
    mockingbird
    nightingale
    owl
    peacock
    pigeons
    red_lories
    rooster
    vulture
    whipperwhill

Soon you'll be able to add your own `wav` files for playback, but not just yet.


Usage
-----

First, create a sound mapping configuration as shown above. Then you can pipe
a log into the `text_to_noise` script and it will start chirping:

    tail -f /var/log/mylog | text_to_noise -c my.sounds.rb

Alternatively, you can run `text_to_noise` on an existing file:

    text_to_noise -c my.sounds.rb -f file.log
    
Text-To-Noise will cease processing when it reaches the end of the file.


TODO
----

At the moment, this only supports playing some free bird songs that are included in the gem.
Highest priority is the ability to add your own sound sets for playback.

  * Add sounds to the available noises for playback
  * Automatically refresh configurations
  * Add generators to create stub configurations
  * Support sound themes?
